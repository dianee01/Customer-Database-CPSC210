# My Personal Project - Customer Log and Tracker

## By Diane Shen, developed as a UBC CPSC210 course project

This project is a customer log and tracker. It will track new customers who have purchased non-zero dollar amount of things in the store. A customer will only be removed from the list if they returned the only item they have purchased. There will be another category to identify VIP customers, which are customers who have purchased more than $1000 dollars within the past calendar year (From 01.01 of that year to 12.31 of that year). Similarily, a customer will be removed from the list if they purchased less than $1000 dollars of things from the store within the past calendar year. This VIP list will update every January 1st. You are also able to view the total amount of sales generated per calendar year. Furthermore, you can arrange customers by their purchasing power/loyalty with the store (greatest dollar amount spent in the store to the least). 

This project can be used by many stores to track their customers and sales. It can help the owner to be organized and stay on top of its business management. It can also help the owner to identify VIP customers from regular customers, which can be used to **evaluate its business strategy** (such as discounts available only to VIP customers) and making **new adjustments to the most current customer behaviors**.

**Main Features Overview**
- customer and sales tracking and organization
- VIP and regular customer differentiation
- sales overview

*As an Economics student, I am interested in connecting economics with computer science, and hope to be able to use my computer science skills to develop tools that can help with businesses and support their decision making. I believe that this project can largely help businesses get organized with their daily sales (especially online stores or stores with large items and a smaller customer database) and become one of the first steps for businesses to become more digitized with their data.**
